what's up? i'm mar√≠a ***(she/her)*** and i'm a graduate in video game creation and storytelling.

i'm a junior game dev who is specialised in production, game design and storytelling, although i also have knowledge about Unity programming (C#), modelling, animation (2D/3D), and more.

also, i'm really interested and committed to accessibility and inclusion in videogames. 

right now i'm in the process of further training and learning, but i'm also working on developing my portfolio.
