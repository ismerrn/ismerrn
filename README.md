Hello, I'm Mar√≠a ***(she/her)***, a graduate in Video Game Creation and Storytelling + title of Expert in Technical Artist.

I'm a junior game developer who is specialized in production, game design and storytelling, although I also have knowledge about programming (Unity - C#), modeling (Blender, 3dsMax, Maya and MagickaVoxel), animation (2D/3D), audiovisual production (Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and Sony Vegas), VFX (Adobe After Effects), eSports and more.

Also, I'm really interested and committed to accessibility, inclusion and social issues (gender equality, LGBT+ community...).

Right now I'm in the process of further training and learning, but I'm also working on developing my portfolio.
