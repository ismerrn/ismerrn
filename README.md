Hello! I'm Mar√≠a ***(she/her)***, a graduate in Video Game Creation and Storytelling + title of Expert in Technical Artist. And currently I'm studying a master degree on User Experience Design (UX/UI).

I'm a junior game developer who is specialized in UX/UI Design and Production. Although I also have knowledge about game design, storytelling, audiovisual production, and eSports.

Also, I'm really interested and committed to accessibility, inclusion, diversity, and social issues (gender equality, and LGBT+ community).
